# Ticketing App
The platform enables users to list tickets for events such as concerts or sports for sale. Likewise, users have the ability to purchase tickets listed by others. Users are free to both list tickets for sale and buy tickets from other listings.

During a purchase attempt, a ticket becomes temporarily 'locked' for a duration of 15 minutes. Within this timeframe, the purchasing user is given the opportunity to input their payment information. While a ticket is in this 'locked' state, it is inaccessible for purchase by any other user. After the 15-minute period elapses, the ticket automatically 'unlocks'. Additionally, users retain the flexibility to edit the prices of their listed tickets, as long as the tickets are not in a 'locked' state.
